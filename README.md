problem 1

I have a friend who is visiting from Europe and he does not understand exactly how much gas he is buying for his car.
We need to write a program that allows him to enter the gallons of gas and convert it to liters (metric system). 
NOTE: One US gallon equals 3.7854 liters. 


problem 2

A major restaurant sends a chef to purchase fruits and vegetables every day. 
Upon returning to the store the chef must enter two pieces of data for each item he purchased. 
The quantity (Example: 2 cases) and the price he paid (Example: $4.67). 
The program has a list of 20 items and after the chef enters the information, the program 
provides a total for the purchases for that day. You need to prepare test data 
for five (5) items: apples, oranges, bananas, lettuce and tomatoes.
